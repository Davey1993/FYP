Concept

A prediction application to determine the outcome of future football fixtures
Utilizes previous game statistics combined with machine learning to predict an outcome.


Why am I developing this application?

There is a gap in the market for technology like such. There are some available but none well-known. For example www.gamastack.com and www.pronxcalcio.com.
The Sports Betting industry is growing and growing, these sort of tools could assist punters in their betting. 


Technologies

Application functionality is currently being developed in Python using a mySQL database.
The application uses an API from rapidapi.com in order to receive up-to-date data required by this application.

The end goal is to deploy this application as a mobile application with the help of ionic framework.
